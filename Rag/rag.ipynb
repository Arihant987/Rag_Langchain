       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention_is_all_you_need.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention_is_all_you_need.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1.

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.

We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

It is the programming paradigm that is deﬁned using objects. Objects \\ncan be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that have some characteristics and behaviours.\\nWhy OOP? 2. \\nThere are many reasons why OOPs is mostly preferred, but the most important among them are:\\nOOPs helps users to understand the software easily, although they don’t know the actual implementation.\\nWith OOPs, the readability, understandability, and maintainability of the code increase multifold.\\nEven very big codebases can be easily written and managed easily using OOPs.●\\n●\\n●OOPS Interview Cheatsheet'),\n",

Some of the major Object-Oriented Programming languages include:\\nJava\\nC++\\nJavascript\\nPython\\nPHP●\\n●\\n●\\n●\\n●\\nAnd many more.\\nWhat is meant by Structured Programming? 4. \\nStructured Programming refers to the method of programming which consists of a completely structured control ﬂow. \\nHere, structure refers to a block, which contains a set of rules, and has a deﬁnitive control ﬂow, such as (if/then/else), \\n(while and for), block structures, and subroutines.\\nWhat are the main features of OOPs?\\xa0[American Express] [Microsoft]\\xa0[Intuit] [Oracle] 5. \\nOOPs or Object Oriented Programming mainly comprises of the below four features:\\nInheritance\\nEncapsulation\\nPolymorphism\\nData Abstraction●\\n●\\n●\\n●\\nWhat are some advantages of using OOPs? 6. \\nHighly complex programs can be created, handled, and maintained easily using object-oriented programming.\\nOOPs, promote code reuse, thereby reducing redundancy.\\nOOPs also helps to hide the unnecessary details with the help of Data Abstraction.\\nOOPs, are based on a bottom-up approach, unlike the Structural programming paradigm, which uses a top-down \\napproach.\\nPolymorphism oﬀers a lot of ﬂexibility in OOPs.●\\n●\\n●\\n●\\n●\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 7.\\xa0 Why is OOPs so popular?\\xa0[Oracle]\\nOOPs programming paradigm is considered as a better style of programming. Not only it helps in writing a complex \\npiece of code easily, but it also allows users to handle and maintain them easily as well. The main pillar of OOPs - Data \\nAbstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism, makes it easy for programmers to solve complex scenarios.\\nWhat is a class? 8. \\nA class is a template or a blueprint, which contains some values, known as member data or member, and some set of \\nrules, known as behaviours or functions. So when an object is created, it automatically takes the data and functions \\nthat are deﬁned in the class.\\nWhat is an object? 9. \\nAn object refers to the instance of the class, which contains the instance of the members and behaviours deﬁned in the \\nclass template. In the real world, an object is an actual entity to which a user interacts, whereas class is just the \\nblueprint for that object. So the objects consume space and have some characteristic behaviour.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'OOPS_Interview_Cheatsheet.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content=\"What is encapsulation? 10. \\nEncapsulation is putting everything that is required to do the job, inside a capsule and presenting that capsule to the \\nuser. What it means is that by Encapsulation, all the necessary data and methods are bind together and all the \\nunnecessary details are hidden to the normal user. So Encapsulation is the process of binding data members and \\nmethods of a program together to do a speciﬁc job, without revealing unnecessary details. \\nEncapsulation can also be deﬁned in two diﬀerent ways: \\n1) Data hiding: Encapsulation is the process of hiding unwanted information, such as restricting access to any member \\nof an object. \\n2) Data binding: Encapsulation is the process of binding the data members and the methods together as a whole, as a \\nclass.\\nWhat is Polymorphism?\\xa0[Microsoft]\\xa0[Intuit]\\xa0 11. \\nPolymorphism is composed of two words - “poly” which means “many”, and “morph” which means “shapes”. Therefore \\nPolymorphism refers to something that has many shapes. In OOPs, Polymorphism refers to the process by which some \\ncode, data, method, or object behaves diﬀerently under diﬀerent circumstances or contexts.\\nWhat are the two types of Polymorphism?\\xa0[American Express] 12. \\nCompile Time Polymorphism: Compile time polymorphism, also known as Static Polymorphism, refers to the type of \\nPolymorphism that happens at compile time. What it means is that the compiler decides what shape or value has to be \\ntaken by the entity in the picture.\\nRuntime Polymorphism:\\xa0Runtime polymorphism, also known as Dynamic Polymorphism, refers to the type of \\nPolymorphism that happens at the run time. What it means is it can't be decided by the compiler. Therefore what \\nshape or value has to be taken depends upon the execution. Hence the name Runtime Polymorphism.\\nHow does C++ support Polymorphism? 13. \\nC++ is an Object-oriented programming language and it supports Polymorphism as well:\\nCompile Time Polymorphism: C++ supports compile-time polymorphism with the help of features like templates, \\nfunction overloading, and default arguments.\\nRuntime Polymorphism: C++ supports Runtime polymorphism with the help of features like virtual functions. \\nVirtual functions take the shape of the functions based on the type of object in reference and are resolved at \\nruntime.●\\n●\\nWhat is meant by Inheritance?\\xa0[Goldman Sachs] 14. \\nThe term “inheritance” means “receiving some quality or behavior from a parent to an oﬀspring.” In object-oriented \\nprogramming, inheritance is the mechanism by which an object or class (referred to as a child) is created using the \\ndeﬁnition of another object or class (referred to as a parent). Inheritance not only helps to keep the implementation \\nsimpler but also helps to facilitate code reuse.\\nWhat is Abstraction?\\xa0 15. \\nAbstraction is the method of hiding unnecessary details from the necessary ones. It is one of the main features of \\nOOPs.  \\nFor example, consider a car. You only need to know how to run a car, and not how the wires are connected inside it. \\nThis is obtained using Abstraction.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'OOPS_Interview_Cheatsheet.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='What are the levels of data abstraction? 16. \\nTo make the system eﬃcient for retrieval of data and reduce the complexity of the users, developers use the method of \\nData Abstraction.\\nThere are mainly three levels of data abstraction:\\nInternal Level: Actual PHYSICAL storage structure and access paths.\\nConceptual or Logical Level: Structure and constraints for the entire database\\nExternal or View level: Describes various user views1. \\n2. \\n3. \\nHow much memory does a class occupy? 17. \\nClasses do not consume any memory. They are just a blueprint based on which objects are created. Now when objects \\nare created, they actually initialise the class members and methods and therefore consume memory.\\nIs it always necessary to create objects from class? 18. \\nNo. An object is necessary to be created if the base class has non-static methods. But if the class has static methods, \\nthen objects don’t need to be created. You can call the class method directly in this case, using the class name.\\nWhat is a constructor?\\xa0[Adobe] 19. \\nConstructors are special methods whose name is the same as the class name. The constructors serve the special \\npurpose of initialising the objects. \\nFor example, suppose there is a class with the name “MyClass”, then when you instantiate this class, you pass the \\nsyntax:\\nMyClass myClassObject = new MyClass();\\nWhat are the various types of constructors in C++? 20. \\nThe most common classiﬁcation of constructors includes:\\nDefault constructor: The default constructor is the constructor which doesn’t take any argument. It has no \\nparameters.●\\n \\nclass ABC \\n{ \\n\\xa0\\xa0 int x; \\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\n\\xa0\\xa0 ABC () \\n\\xa0\\xa0 { \\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 x = 0; \\n\\xa0\\xa0 } \\n}\\nParameterised constructor: The constructors that take some arguments are known as parameterised constructors. ●\\n\\xa0class ABC \\n{ \\n\\xa0\\xa0 int x; \\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\n\\xa0\\xa0 ABC (int y) \\n\\xa0\\xa0 { '),\n",

What it means is that a copy \\nconstructor will clone an object and its values, into another object, is provided that both the objects are of the same \\nclass.\\nWhat is a destructor?\\xa0[Oracle] 22. \\nContrary to constructors, which initialise objects and specify space for them, Destructors are also special methods. But \\ndestructors free up the resources and memory occupied by an object. Destructors are automatically called when an \\nobject is being destroyed.\\nAre class and structure the same? If not, what's the diﬀerence between a class and a structure? 23. \\nNo, class and structure are not the same. Though they appear to be similar, they have diﬀerences that make them \\napart. For example, the structure is saved in the stack memory, whereas the class is saved in the heap memory. Also, \\nData Abstraction cannot be achieved with the help of structure, but with class, Abstraction is majorly used.\\nExplain Inheritance.\\xa0[American Express] [ServiceNow] 24. \\nInheritance is one of the major features of object-oriented programming, by which an entity inherits some \\ncharacteristics and behaviours of some other entity and makes them their own. Inheritance helps to improve and \\nfacilitate code reuse.\\nLet me explain to you with a common example. Let's take three diﬀerent vehicles - a car, truck, or bus. These three are \\nentirely diﬀerent from one another with their own speciﬁc characteristics and behavior. But, in all three, you will ﬁnd \\nsome common elements, like steering wheel, accelerator, clutch, brakes, etc. Though these elements are used in \\ndiﬀerent vehicles, still they have their own features which are common among all vehicles. This is achieved with \\ninheritance. The car, the truck, and the bus have all inherited the features like steering wheel, accelerator, clutch, \\nbrakes, etc, and used them as their own. Due to this, they did not have to create these components from scratch, \\nthereby facilitating code reuse.\\nAre there any limitations of Inheritance? 25. \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'OOPS_Interview_Cheatsheet.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Yes, Inheritance is a very powerful feature in OOPs, but it has some limitations too. Inheritance needs more time to \\nprocess, as it needs to navigate through multiple classes for its implementation. Also, the classes involved in \\nInheritance - the base class and the child class, are very tightly coupled together. So if one needs to make some \\nchanges, they might need to do nested changes in both classes. Inheritance might be complex for implementation, as \\nwell. So if not correctly implemented, this might lead to unexpected errors or incorrect outputs.\\nWhat are the various types of inheritance?\\xa0[American Express]\\xa0[Microsoft]\\xa0 26. \\nThe various types of inheritance include:\\nSingle inheritance\\nMultiple inheritances\\nMulti-level inheritance\\nHierarchical inheritance\\nHybrid inheritance●\\n●\\n●\\n●\\n●\\nWhat is an Interface?\\xa0[Goldman Sachs] 27. \\nAn interface refers to a special type of class, which contains methods, but not their deﬁnition. Only the declaration of \\nmethods is allowed inside an interface. To use an interface, you cannot create objects. Instead, you need to implement \\nthat interface and deﬁne the methods for their implementation.\\xa0\\nWhat is meant by static polymorphism? 28. \\nStatic Polymorphism is commonly known as the Compile time polymorphism. Static polymorphism is the feature by \\nwhich an object is linked with the respective function or operator based on the values during the compile time. Static \\nor Compile time Polymorphism can be achieved through Method overloading or operator overloading.\\nWhat is meant by dynamic polymorphism? 29. \\nDynamic Polymorphism or Runtime polymorphism refers to the type of Polymorphism in OOPs, by which the actual \\nimplementation of the function is decided during the runtime or execution. The dynamic or runtime polymorphism \\ncan be achieved with the help of method overriding.\\nWhat is function overloading? Explain with an example.\\xa0[American Express] 30. \\nFunction overloading is a feature of object oriented programming where two or more functions can have the same \\nname but diﬀerent parameters.\\n#include  <bits /stdc ++.h> \\nusing namespace  std ; \\n\\xa0 \\nvoid print (int i) { \\n\\xa0\\xa0cout << \" Here is int \"  << i << endl ; \\n} \\n \\nvoid print (double \\xa0f) { \\n\\xa0\\xa0cout << \" Here is float \"  << f << endl ; \\n} \\n \\nvoid print (string \\xa0s) { \\n\\xa0\\xa0cout << \" Here is string \"  <<\\xa0s\\xa0<< endl ; \\n} \\n\\xa0 \\nint main () { '),\n",

For example, method overloading and operator overloading.\\nWhereas Overriding is a runtime polymorphism feature in which an entity has the same name, but its implementation \\nchanges during execution. For example, method overriding.\\nWhat is an abstract class? 32. \\nAn abstract class is a special class containing abstract methods. The signiﬁcance of abstract class is that the abstract \\nmethods inside it are not implemented and only declared. So as a result, when a subclass inherits the abstract class \\nand needs to use its abstract methods, they need to deﬁne and implement them.\\nHow is an abstract class diﬀerent from an interface? 33. \\nInterface and abstract class both are special types of classes that contain only the methods declaration and not their \\nimplementation. But the interface is entirely diﬀerent from an abstract class. The main diﬀerence between the two is \\nthat, when an interface is implemented, the subclass must deﬁne all its methods and provide its implementation. \\nWhereas when an abstract class is inherited, the subclass does not need to provide the deﬁnition of its abstract \\nmethod, until and unless the subclass is using it.\\nWhat is a friend function?\\xa0[Adobe]\\xa0 34. \\nA friend function of a class is deﬁned outside that class\\' scope but it has the right to access all private and protected \\nmembers of the class. Even though the prototypes for friend functions appear in the class deﬁnition, friends are not \\nmember functions.\\nA friend can be a function, function template, or member function, or a class or class template, in which case the entire\\nclass and all of its members are friends.\\nclass Box { \\n\\xa0\\xa0 double width ; \\n\\xa0\\xa0  \\n\\xa0\\xa0 public : \\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0friend void printWidth ( Box box ); \\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0void setWidth ( double wid ); \\n}; \\n \\n// Member function definition  \\nvoid Box::setWidth ( double wid ) { \\n\\xa0\\xa0 width = wid ; \\n} \\n \\n \\nvoid printWidth ( Box box ) { \\n\\xa0\\xa0 /* Because printWidth() is a friend of Box, it can  \\n\\xa0\\xa0 directly access any member of this class */  \\n\\xa0\\xa0 cout << \"Width of box : \"  << box .width <<endl ; \\n} '),\n",

The reason for the exception is mainly due to a position in the program, where the user \\nwants to do something for which the program is not speciﬁed, like undesirable input.\\nWhat is meant by exception handling? 37. \\nExceptions are the major reason for software failure. The exceptions can be handled in the program beforehand and \\nprevent the execution from stopping. This is known as exception handling. \\nSo exception handling is the mechanism for identifying the undesirable states that the program can reach and \\nspecifying the desirable outcomes of such states. Try-catch is the most common method used for handling exceptions \\nin the program.\\nWhat is meant by Garbage Collection in OOPs world? 38. \\nObject-oriented programming revolves around entities like objects. Each object consumes memory and there can be \\nmultiple objects of a class. So if these objects and their memories are not handled properly, then it might lead to \\ncertain memory-related errors and the system might fail.\\nGarbage collection refers to this mechanism of handling the memory in the program. Through garbage collection, the \\nunwanted memory is freed up by removing the objects that are no longer needed.\\nCan we run a Java application without implementing the OOPs concept? 39. \\nNo, Java applications are based on object-oriented programming models, and hence they cannot be implemented \\nwithout it.\\nCan we run a C++ application without implementing the OOPs concept? 40. \\nYes, C++ can be implemented without OOPs, as it supports the C-like structural programming model.\\nWhat is a virtual function?\\xa0[American Express]\\xa0[Goldman Sachs] [Adobe] [Microsoft]\\xa0 41. \\nA virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-deﬁned(overriden) by a derived \\nclass.

In other words, it is a way to destroy the unused objects.\\xa0To do so, we use free() function in C language, \\ndelete() in C++, but in Java, it is performed automatically.\\xa0\\nWhat is composition? 45. \\nComposition is a way to design or implement the \"has-a\" relationship.\\xa0The composition relationship of two objects is \\npossible when one object contains another object, and that object is fully dependent on it. The contained object \\nshould not exist without the existence of its parent object.\\xa0\\nIn a simple way, we can say it is a technique through which we can describe the reference between two or more \\nclasses. And for that, we use the instance variable, which should be created before it is used.\\nWhat is copy assignment operator? 46. \\nThe copy assignment operator lets you create a new object from an existing one by initialisation. A copy assignment \\noperator of a class A is a non-static non-template member function that has one of the following forms:\\nA::operator=(A)\\nA::operator=(A&)\\nA::operator=(const A&)\\nA::operator=(volatile A&)\\nA::operator=(const volatile A&)●\\n●\\n●\\n●\\n●\\nName the operators that cannot be overloaded. 47. \\nIn C++, following operators can not be overloaded:\\n.

It does not mean that we change the \\nvalue of a variable, it only modiﬁes the I/O stream using insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators. For example, if \\nwe want to print the hexadecimal value of 100 then we can print it as:\\xa0\\ncout <<setbase (16)<<100;'),\n",

In the real world, an object is an actual entity to which a user interacts, whereas class is just the \\nblueprint for that object. So the objects consume space and have some characteristic behaviour.')]"

It is the ability to selectively concentrate on relevant information while filtering out irrelevant information.\\n\\n2. Components of attention: Attention can be divided into different components such as selective attention (the ability to focus on one stimulus while ignoring others), sustained attention (the ability to maintain focus over an extended period of time), divided attention (the ability to focus on multiple tasks simultaneously), and executive attention (the ability to control and regulate attention).\\n\\n3. Importance of attention: Attention is crucial for various cognitive processes such as learning, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making. It allows individuals to effectively process and respond to information in their environment.\\n\\n4. Factors influencing attention: Attention can be influenced by various factors such as arousal levels, motivation, individual differences, and external distractions. For example, high levels of arousal can enhance attention, while distractions can hinder attention.\\n\\n5. Disorders related to attention: Attention deficits can manifest in various disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which is characterized by difficulties in sustaining attention, controlling impulses, and hyperactivity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, attention is a complex cognitive process that involves focusing on relevant information while filtering out distractions. It plays a crucial role in various cognitive processes and can be influenced by factors such as arousal levels, motivation, and distractions. Understanding attention is essential for improving cognitive functioning and addressing attention-related disorders.'"
