       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content='The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\nâ€¦\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between usâ€”however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendshipâ€”exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our heartsâ€”for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.')]"

While data is raw and unorganized, information is organized.\\nc. Data points are individual and sometimes unrelated. Information maps out that data to provide a\\nbig-picture view of how it all fits together.\\nd. Data, on its own, is meaningless. When it’s analyzed and interpreted, it becomes meaningful\\ninformation.\\ne. Data does not depend on information; however, information depends on data.\\nf. Data typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, or statistics. Information is typically\\npresented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas.\\ng. Data isn’t sufficient for decision-making, but you can make decisions based on information.\\n5. What is Database?\\na. Database is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can be easily accessed,\\nmanaged, and updated.\\nb. To make real use Data, we need Database management systems. (DBMS)\\n6. What is DBMS?\\na. A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of\\nprograms to access those data. The collection of data, usually referred to as the database,\\ncontains information relevant to an enterprise. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to\\nstore and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.\\nb. A DBMS is the database itself, along with all the software and functionality. It is used to perform\\ndifferent operations, like addition, access, updating, and deletion of the data.\\nCodeHelp\\n* i\\n->\\n-\\n=>\\ninterest\\nS\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nS\\ndo& &\\n-\\n↑\\nmei -\\nIDPStol?'),\n",

The major purpose of DBMS is to provide users with an abstract view of the data. That is, the\\nsystem hides certain details of how the data is stored and maintained.\\nb.

Goal: ease to use.\\nf. View level / External level:\\ni. Highest level of abstraction aims to simplify users’ interaction with the system by\\nproviding different view to different end-user.\\nii. Each view schema describes the database part that a particular user group is interested\\nand hides the remaining database from that user group.\\niii. At the external level, a database contains several schemas that sometimes called as\\nsubschema. The subschema is used to describe the different view of the database.\\niv.

Specialisation\\n1. In ER model, we may require to subgroup an entity set into other entity sets that are distinct in some way with other\\nentity sets.\\n2. Specialisation is splitting up the entity set into further sub entity sets on the basis of their functionalities,\\nspecialities and features.\\n3. It is a Top-Down approach.\\n4. e.g., Person entity set can be divided into customer, student, employee. Person is superclass and other specialised\\nentity sets are subclasses.\\n1. We have “is-a” relationship between superclass and subclass.\\n2. Depicted by triangle component.\\n5. Why Specialisation?\\n1. Certain attributes may only be applicable to a few entities of\\nthe parent entity set.\\n2. DB designer can show the distinctive features of the sub entities.\\n3. To group such entities we apply Specialisation, to overall refine the DB blueprint.\\n3. Generalisation\\n1. It is just a reverse of Specialisation.\\n2. DB Designer, may encounter certain properties of two entities are overlapping. Designer may consider to make a\\nnew generalised entity set. That generalised entity set will be a super class.\\n3. “is-a” relationship is present between subclass and super class.\\n4. e.g., Car, Jeep and Bus all have some common attributes, to avoid data repetition for the common a ttributes.

A relational DB consists of collection of tables, each of which is assigned a unique name.\\n3. A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values, and table is collection of such relationships.\\n4. Tuple: A single row of the table representing a single data point / a unique record.\\n5. Columns: represents the attributes of the relation. Each attribute, there is a permitted value, called domain of the\\nattribute.\\n6. Relation Schema: defines the design and structure of the relation, contains the name of the relation and all the\\ncolumns/attributes.\\n7. Common RM based DBMS systems, aka RDBMS: Oracle, IBM, MySQL, MS Access.\\n8. Degree of table: number of attributes/columns in a given table/relation.\\n9. Cardinality: Total no. of tuples in a given relation.\\n10. Relational Key: Set of attributes which can uniquely identify an each tuple.\\n11. Important properties of a Table in Relational Model\\n1. The name of relation is distinct among all other relation.\\n2. The values have to be atomic. Can’t be broken down further.\\n3. The name of each attribute/column must be unique.\\n4. Each tuple must be unique in a table.\\n5. The sequence of row and column has no significance.\\n6. Tables must follow integrity constraints - it helps to maintain data consistency across the tables.\\n12. Relational Model Keys\\n1. Super Key (SK): Any P&C of attributes present in a table which can uniquely identify each tuple.\\n2. Candidate Key (CK): minimum subset of super keys, which can uniquely identify each tuple. It contains no\\nredundant attribute.\\n1. CK value shouldn’t be NULL.\\n3. Primary Key (PK):\\n1. Selected out of CK set, has the least no. of a ttributes.\\n4. Alternate Key (AK)\\n1. All CK except PK.\\n5. Foreign Key (FK)\\n1. It creates relation between two tables.\\n2. A relation, say r1, may include among its attributes the PK of an other relation, say r2. This attribute is called FK\\nfrom r1 referencing r2.\\n3. The relation r1 is aka Referencing (Child) relation of the FK dependency, and r2 is called Referenced (Parent)\\nrelation of the FK.\\n4. FK helps to cross reference between two di fferent relations.\\n6. Composite Key: PK formed using at least 2 attributes.\\n7. Compound Key: PK which is formed using 2 FK.\\n8. Surrogate Key:\\n1. Synthetic PK.\\n2. Generated automatically by DB, usually an integer value.\\n3. May be used as PK.\\n13. Integrity Constraints\\n1. CRUD Operations must be done with some integrity policy so that DB is always consistent.\\n2. Introduced so that we do not accidentally corrupt the DB.\\n3. Domain Constraints\\n1.

If FK in referencing table refers to PK of referenced table then every value of the FK in referencing table must be \\nNULL or available in referenced table. \\n4. FK must have the matching PK for its each value in the parent table or it must be NULL.  \\n6. Key Constraints: The six types of key constraints present in the Database management system are:-  \\n1. NOT NULL:  This constraint will restrict the user from not having a NULL value. It ensures that every element in \\nthe database has a value. \\n2.

The default value is added to the columns if no value \\nis specified for them.  \\n4. CHECK: It is one of the integrity constraints in DBMS. It keeps the check that integrity of data is maintained \\nbefore and after the completion of the CRUD. \\n5.

Table 3: current-account (account-number, overdraft-amount, per-transaction-charges)\\n2. Method-2: An alternative representation is possible, if the generalisation is disjoint and complete—that is, if no\\nentity is a member of two lower-level entity sets directly below a higher-level entity set, and if every entity in\\nthe higher level entity set is also a member of one of the lower-level entity sets. Here, do not create a table for\\nthe higher-level entity set. Instead, for each lower-level entity set, create a table that includes a column for each\\nof the attributes of that entity set plus a column for each a ttribute of the higher-level entity sets.\\nTables would be:\\n1.

Anomalies\\n1. Anomalies means abnormalities, there are three types of anomalies introduced by data redundancy.\\n2. Insertion anomaly\\n1. When certain data (attribute) can not be inserted into the DB without the presence of other data.\\n3. Deletion anomaly\\n1. The delete anomaly refers to the situation where the deletion of data results in the unintended loss of some\\nother important data.\\n4. Updation anomaly (or modification anomaly)\\n1. The update anomaly is when an update of a single data value requires multiple rows of data to be updated.\\n2. Due to updation to many places, may be Data inconsistency arises, if one forgets to update the data at all the\\nintended places.\\n5. Due to these anomalies, DB size increases and DB performance become very slow.\\n6.

Normalisation is used to minimise the redundancy from a relations. It is also used to eliminate undesirable\\ncharacteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies.\\n2. Normalisation divides the composite attributes into individual attributes OR larger table into smaller and links them\\nusing relationships.\\n3.

If T fails at any time before db-pointer is updated, the old content of DB are not a ffected.\\n2. T abort can be done by just deleting the new copy of DB.\\n3. Hence, either all updates are reflected or none.\\n9. Durability \\n1. Suppose, system fails are any time before the updated db-pointer is wri tten to disk. \\n2. When the system restarts, it will read db-pointer & will thus, see the original content of DB and none of the e ffects of T will \\nbe visible. \\n3.

Luckily, disk system provide atomic updates to entire \\nblock or at least a disk sector. So, we make sure db-pointer lies entirely in a single sector.

Indexing is used to optimise the performance of a database by minimising the number of disk accesses required when a query is \\nprocessed. \\n2. The index is a type of data structure. It is used to locate and access the data in a database table quickly. \\n3. Speeds up operation with read operations like SELECT queries, WHERE clause etc. \\n4. Search Key: Contains copy of primary key or candidate key \\nof the table or something else. \\n5. Data Reference: Pointer holding the address of disk block \\nwhere the value of the corresponding key is stored. \\n6. Indexing is optional, but increases access speed. It is not the \\nprimary mean to access the tuple, it is the secondary mean.  \\n7. Index file is always sorted. \\n8. Indexing Methods \\n1. Primary Index (Clustering Index) \\n1. A file may have several indices, on different search keys. If the data file containing the records is sequentially ordered, a \\nPrimary index is an index whose search key also de fines the sequential order of the file. \\n2. NOTE: The term primary index is sometimes used to mean an index on a primary key. However, such usage is \\nnonstandard and should be avoided. \\n3. All files are ordered sequentially on some search key. It could be Primary Key or non-primary key.  \\n4. Dense And Sparse Indices \\n1. Dense Index \\n1. The dense index contains an index record for every search key value in the data file. \\n2. The index record contains the search-key value and a pointer to the first data record with that search-key value. \\nThe rest of the records with the same search-key value would be stored sequentially a fter the first record. \\n3. It needs more space to store index record itself. The index records have the search key and a pointer to the actual \\nrecord on the disk. \\n2. Sparse Index \\n1. An index record appears for only some of the search-key values.  \\n2. Sparse Index helps you to resolve the issues of dense Indexing in DBMS. In this method of indexing technique, a \\nrange of index columns stores the same data block address, and when data needs to be retrieved, the block \\naddress will be fetched. \\n5. Primary Indexing can be based on Data file is sorted w.r.t Primary Key attribute or non-key attributes. \\n6. Based on Key attribute \\n1. Data file is sorted w.r.t primary key attribute. \\n2. PK will be used as search-key in Index.  \\n3. Sparse Index will be formed i.e., no. of entries in the index file = no. of blocks in datafile. \\n7. Based on Non-Key attribute \\n1. Data file is sorted w.r.t non-key attribute. \\n2. No. Of entries in the index  = unique non-key attribute value in the data file. \\n3. This is dense index as, all the unique values have an entry in the \\nindex file. \\n4. E.g., Let’s assume that a company recruited many employees in \\nvarious departments. In this case, clustering indexing in DBMS \\nshould be created for all employees who belong to the same \\ndept. \\n8. Multi-level Index \\n1. Index with two or more levels. \\n2. If the single level index become enough large that the binary \\nsearch it self would take much time, we can break down \\nindexing into multiple levels. \\n2. Secondary Index (Non-Clustering Index) \\n1. Datafile is unsorted. Hence, Primary Indexing is not possible.  \\n2. Can be done on key or non-key attribute. \\n3. Called secondary indexing because normally one indexing is already \\napplied. \\n4. No. Of entries in the index file = no. of records in the data file. \\n5.

NoSQL databases (aka \"not only SQL\") are non-tabular databases and store data di fferently than relational tables. NoSQL databases \\ncome in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They \\nprovide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.\\n1. They are schema free.\\n2. Data structures used are not tabular, they are more flexible, has the ability to adjust dynamically.\\n3. Can handle huge amount of data (big data). \\n4. Most of the NoSQL are open sources and has the capability of horizontal scaling.\\n5. It just stores data in some format other than relational. \\n2. History behind NoSQL \\n1. NoSQL databases emerged in the late 2000s as the cost of storage dramatically decreased. Gone were the days of needing to \\ncreate a complex, di fficult-to-manage data model in order to avoid data duplication. Developers (rather than storage) were \\nbecoming the primary cost of software development, so NoSQL databases optimised for developer productivity.  \\n2. Data becoming unstructured more, hence structuring (defining schema in advance) them had becoming costly.\\n3. NoSQL databases allow developers to store huge amounts of unstructured data, giving them a lot of flexibility.\\n4. Recognising the need to rapidly adapt to changing requirements in a so ftware system. Developers needed the ability to iterate \\nquickly and make changes throughout their so ftware stack — all the way down to the database. NoSQL databases gave them \\nthis flexibility. \\n5. Cloud computing also rose in popularity, and developers began using public clouds to host their applications and data. They \\nwanted the ability to distribute data across multiple servers and regions to make their applications resilient, to scale out instead \\nof scale up, and to intelligently geo-place their data. Some NoSQL databases like MongoDB provide these capabilities.  \\n3. NoSQL Databases Advantages \\nA. Flexible Schema \\n1. RDBMS has pre-de fined schema, which become an issue when we do not have all the data with us or we need to change \\nthe schema. It\\'s a huge task to change schema on the go. \\nB. Horizontal Scaling \\n1. Horizontal scaling, also known as scale-out, refers to bringing on additional nodes to share the load. This is di fficult with \\nrelational databases due to the di fficulty in spreading out related data across nodes. With non-relational databases, this is \\nmade simpler since collections are self-contained and not coupled relationally. This allows them to be distributed across \\nnodes more simply, as queries do not have to “join” them together across nodes. \\n2. Scaling horizontally is achieved through Sharding OR Replica-sets.\\nC. High Availability \\n1. NoSQL databases are highly available due to its auto replication feature i.e. whenever any kind of failure happens data \\nreplicates itself to the preceding consistent state.  \\n2. If a server fails, we can access that data from another server as well, as in NoSQL database data is stored at multiple \\nservers. \\nD. Easy insert and read operations. \\n1. Queries in NoSQL databases can be faster than SQL databases. Why? Data in SQL databases is typically normalised, so \\nqueries for a single object or entity require you to join data from multiple tables. As your tables grow in size, the joins can \\nbecome expensive. However, data in NoSQL databases is typically stored in a way that is optimised for queries. The rule of \\nthumb when you use MongoDB is data that is accessed together should be stored together. Queries typically do not require \\njoins, so the queries are very fast.  \\n2. But difficult delete or update operations.\\nE. Caching mechanism. \\nF. NoSQL use case is more for Cloud applications.\\n4. When to use NoSQL? \\n1. Fast-paced Agile development\\n2. Storage of structured and semi-structured data\\n3. Huge volumes of data\\n4. Requirements for scale-out architecture\\n5. Modern application paradigms like micro-services and real-time streaming.\\n5. NoSQL DB Misconceptions \\n1. Relationship data is best suited for relational databases.\\n1. A common misconception is that NoSQL databases or non-relational databases don’t store relationship data well. NoSQL \\ndatabases can store relationship data — they just store it di fferently than relational databases do. In fact, when compared \\nwith relational databases, many find modelling relationship data in NoSQL databases to be easier than in relational \\ndatabases, because related data doesn’t have to be split between tables. NoSQL data models allow related data to be \\nnested within a single data structure.  \\n2.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'DBMS_my_notes.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='1. Another common misconception is that NoSQL databases don\\'t support ACID transactions. Some NoSQL databases like \\nMongoDB do, in fact, support ACID transactions.  \\n6. Types of NoSQL Data Models \\n1. Key-Value Stores \\n1. The simplest type of NoSQL database is a key-value store. Every data element in the database is stored as a key value pair \\nconsisting of an a ttribute name (or \"key\") and a value. In a sense, a key-value store is like a relational database with only \\ntwo columns: the key or attribute name (such as \"state\") and the value (such as \"Alaska\"). \\n2. Use cases include shopping carts, user preferences, and user pro files. \\n3. e.g., Oracle NoSQL, Amazon DynamoDB, MongoDB also supports Key-Value store, Redis.  \\n4. A key-value database associates a value (which can be anything from a number or simple string to a complex object) with \\na key, which is used to keep track of the object. In its simplest form, a key-value store is like a dictionary/array/map object \\nas it exists in most programming paradigms, but which is stored in a persistent way and managed by a Database \\nManagement System (DBMS). \\n5. Key-value databases use compact, e fficient index structures to be able to quickly and reliably locate a value by its key, \\nmaking them ideal for systems that need to be able to find and retrieve data in constant time. \\n6. There are several use-cases where choosing a key value store approach is an optimal solution:  \\na) Real time random data access, e.g., user session a ttributes in an online application such as gaming or finance. \\nb) Caching mechanism for frequently accessed data or con figuration based on keys. \\nc) Application is designed on simple key-based queries.  \\n2. Column-Oriented / Columnar / C-Store / Wide-Column \\n1. The data is stored such that each row of a column will be next to other rows from that same column.  \\n2. While a relational database stores data in rows and reads data row by row, a column store is organised as a set of columns. \\nThis means that when you want to run analytics on a small number of columns, you can read those columns directly \\nwithout consuming memory with the unwanted data. Columns are o ften of the same type and bene fit from more e fficient \\ncompression, making reads even faster. Columnar databases can quickly aggregate the value of a given column (adding up \\nthe total sales for the year, for example). Use cases include analytics. \\n3. e.g., Cassandra, RedShi ft, Snowflake. \\n3. Document Based Stores \\n1. This DB store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each document contains pairs of \\nfields and values. The values can typically be a variety of types including things like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or \\nobjects. \\n2. Use cases include e-commerce platforms, trading platforms, and mobile app development across industries.  \\n3. Supports ACID properties hence, suitable for Transactions.  \\n4. e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB. \\n4. Graph Based Stores \\n1. A graph database focuses on the relationship between data elements. Each element is stored as a node (such as a person \\nin a social media graph). The connections between elements are called links or relationships. In a graph database, \\nconnections are first-class elements of the database, stored directly. In relational databases, links are implied, using data to \\nexpress the relationships. \\n2. A graph database is optimised to capture and search the connections between data elements, overcoming the overhead \\nassociated with JOINing multiple tables in SQL.  \\n3. Very few real-world business systems can survive solely on graph queries. As a result graph databases are usually run \\nalongside other more traditional databases. \\n4. Use cases include fraud detection, social networks, and knowledge graphs.  \\n7. NoSQL Databases Dis-advantages \\n1. Data Redundancy \\n1. Since data models in NoSQL databases are typically optimised for queries and not for reducing data duplication, NoSQL \\ndatabases can be larger than SQL databases. Storage is currently so cheap that most consider this a minor drawback, and \\nsome NoSQL databases also support compression to reduce the storage footprint.  \\n2. Update & Delete operations are costly. \\n3. All type of NoSQL Data model doesn’t fulfil all of your application needs \\n1. Depending on the NoSQL database type you select, you may not be able to achieve all of your use cases in a single \\ndatabase. For example, graph databases are excellent for analysing relationships in your data but may not provide what \\nyou need for everyday retrieval of the data such as range queries. When selecting a NoSQL database, consider what your \\nuse cases will be and if a general purpose database like MongoDB would be a be tter option. \\n4.

Relational databases are quite popular, even though it was a system designed in the 1970s. Also known as relational database \\nmanagement systems (RDBMS), relational databases commonly use Structured Query Language (SQL)  for operations such as \\ncreating, reading, updating, and deleting data. Relational databases store information in discrete tables, which can be JOINed \\ntogether by fields known as foreign keys. For example, you might have a User table which contains information about all your \\nusers, and join it to a Purchases table, which contains information about all the purchases they’ve made.

Scalability issues (Horizontal Scaling). \\n8. Data become huge, system become more complex.\\n2. Object Oriented Databases \\n1. The object-oriented data model, is based on the object-oriented-programming paradigm, which is now in wide use. \\nInheritance, object-identity, and encapsulation (information hiding), with methods to provide an interface to objects, are \\namong the key concepts of object-oriented programming that have found applications in data modelling. The object-oriented \\ndata model also supports a rich type system, including structured and collection types. While inheritance and, to some extent, \\ncomplex types are also present in the E-R model, encapsulation and object-identity distinguish the object-oriented data model \\nfrom the E-R model. \\n2. Sometimes the database can be very complex, having multiple relations. So, maintaining a relationship between them can be \\ntedious at times. \\n1. In Object-oriented databases data is treated as an object.\\n2. All bits of information come in one instantly available object package instead of multiple tables.\\n3. Advantages \\n1.

Hierarchical Databases \\n1. As the name suggests, the hierarchical database model is most appropriate for use cases in which the main focus of information \\ngathering is based on a concrete hierarchy , such as several individual employees reporting to a single department at a \\ncompany. \\n2. The schema for hierarchical databases is de fined by its tree-like organisation, in which there is typically a root “parent” \\ndirectory of data stored as records that links to various other subdirectory branches, and each subdirectory branch, or child \\nrecord, may link to various other subdirectory branches.  \\n3. The hierarchical database structure dictates that, while a parent record can have several child records, each child record can only \\nhave one parent record. Data within records is stored in the form of fields, and each field can only contain one value. Retrieving \\nhierarchical data from a hierarchical database architecture requires traversing the entire tree, starting at the root node.  \\n4. Since the disk storage system is also inherently a hierarchical structure, these models can also be used as physical models.\\n5. The key advantage of a hierarchical database is its ease of use. The one-to-many organisation of data makes traversing the \\ndatabase simple and fast, which is ideal for use cases such as website drop-down menus or computer folders in systems like \\nCodeHelp\\nHandle is object id\\nObjects communicate between each other i.e. relation through methods\\n&\\n-\\nX\\n-\\nAren -\\n-\\nE-\\nmorgoe\\nyoueeg\\n-·\\nN\\n-\\n-\\nseem'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'DBMS_my_notes.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='LEC-17: Clustering in DBMS \\n1. Database Clustering (making Replica-sets) is the process of combining more than one servers or instances connecting a single database. \\nSometimes one server may not be adequate to manage the amount of data or the number of requests, that is when a Data Cluster is needed. \\nDatabase clustering, SQL server clustering, and SQL clustering are closely associated with SQL is the language used to manage the database \\ninformation. \\n2. Replicate the same dataset on different servers. \\n3. Advantages\\n1. Data Redundancy: Clustering of databases helps with data redundancy, as we store the same data at multiple servers. Don’t confuse this \\ndata redundancy as repetition of the same data that might lead to some anomalies. The redundancy that clustering offers is required and is \\nquite certain due to the synchronisation. In case any of the servers had to face a failure due to any possible reason, the data is available at other \\nservers to access.\\n2. Load balancing: or scalability doesn’t come by default with the database. It has to be brought by clustering regularly. It also depends on the \\nsetup. Basically, what load balancing does is allocating the workload among the different servers that are part of the cluster. This indicates that \\nmore users can be supported and if for some reasons if a huge spike in the traf ﬁc appears, there is a higher assurance that it will be able to \\nsupport the new trafﬁc. One machine is not going to get all of the hits. This can provide scaling seamlessly as required. This links directly to \\nhigh availability. Without load balancing, a particular machine could get overworked and traf ﬁc would slow down, leading to decrement of \\nthe trafﬁc to zero. \\n3. High availability: When you can access a database, it implies that it is available. High availability refers the amount of time a database is \\nconsidered available. The amount of availability you need greatly depends on the number of transactions you are running on your database \\nand how often you are running any kind of analytics on your data. With database clustering, we can reach extremely high levels of availability \\ndue to load balancing and have extra machines. In case a server got shut down the database will, however, be available. \\n4. How does Clustering Work?\\n1. In cluster architecture, all requests are split with many computers so that an individual user request is executed and produced by a number of \\ncomputer systems. The clustering is serviceable de ﬁnitely by the ability of load balancing and high-availability. If one node collapses, the \\nrequest is handled by another node. Consequently, there are few or no possibilities of absolute system failures.\\nCodeHelp\\nContent delivery network\\nDis\\nmongo ~eg =>\\nO\\nof↑ag\\nd\\nX\\no eas'),\n",

A big problem can be solved easily when it is chopped into several smaller sub-problems. That is what the partitioning technique does. It divides a \\nbig database containing data metrics and indexes into smaller and handy slices of data called partitions. The partitioned tables are directly used by \\nSQL queries without any alteration. Once the database is partitioned, the data de ﬁnition language can easily work on the smaller partitioned slices, \\ninstead of handling the giant database altogether. This is how partitioning cuts down the problems in managing large database tables. \\n2. Partitioning is the technique used to divide stored database objects into separate servers. Due to this, there is an increase in performance, \\ncontrollability of the data. We can manage huge chunks of data optimally. When we horizontally scale our machines/servers, we know that it gives us \\na challenging time dealing with relational databases as it’s quite tough to maintain the relations. But if we apply partitioning to the database that is \\nalready scaled out i.e. equipped with multiple servers, we can partition our database among those servers and handle the big data easily. \\n3.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'DBMS_my_notes.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='LEC-20: CAP Theorem \\n1. Basic and one of the most important concept in Distributed Databases. \\n2. Useful to know this to design efﬁcient distributed system for your given business logic. \\n3. Let’s ﬁrst breakdown CAP \\n1. Consistency: In a consistent system, all nodes see the same data simultaneously. If we perform a read operation on a consistent system, it \\nshould return the value of the most recent write operation. The read should cause all nodes to return the same data. All users see the same data \\nat the same time, regardless of the node they connect to. When data is written to a single node, it is then replicated across the other nodes in \\nthe system. \\n2. Availability: When availability is present in a distributed system, it means that the system remains operational all of the time. Every request \\nwill get a response regardless of the individual state of the nodes. This means that the system will operate even if there are multiple nodes \\ndown. Unlike a consistent system, there’s no guarantee that the response will be the most recent write operation. \\n3. Partition Tolerance: When a distributed system encounters a partition, it means that there’s a break in communication between nodes. If a \\nsystem is partition-tolerant, the system does not fail, regardless of whether messages are dropped or delayed between nodes within the \\nsystem. To have partition tolerance, the system must replicate records across combinations of nodes and networks. \\n4. What does the CAP Theorem says, \\n1. The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only provide two of three properties simultaneously: consistency, availability, and \\npartition tolerance. The theorem formalises the tradeoff between consistency and availability when there’s a partition. \\n5. CAP Theorem NoSQL Databases: NoSQL databases are great for distributed networks. They allow for horizontal scaling, and they can quickly scale \\nacross multiple nodes. When deciding which NoSQL database to use, it’s important to keep the CAP theorem in mind. \\n1. CA Databases: CA databases enable consistency and availability across all nodes. Unfortunately, CA databases can’t deliver fault tolerance. In \\nany distributed system, partitions are bound to happen, which means this type of database isn’t a very practical choice. That being said, you still \\ncan ﬁnd a CA database if you need one. Some relational databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, allow for consistency and availability. You can \\ndeploy them to nodes using replication. \\n2. CP Databases: CP databases enable consistency and partition tolerance, but not availability. When a partition occurs, the system has to turn \\noff inconsistent nodes until the partition can be ﬁxed. MongoDB is an example of a CP database. It’s a NoSQL database management system \\n(DBMS) that uses documents for data storage. It’s considered schema-less, which means that it doesn’t require a deﬁned database schema. It’s \\ncommonly used in big data and applications running in different locations. The CP system is structured so that there’s only one primary \\nnode that receives all of the write requests in a given replica set.  Secondary nodes replicate the data in the primary nodes, so if the \\nprimary node fails, a secondary node can stand-in. In banking system Availability is not as important as consistency, so we can opt it \\n(MongoDB).\\n3. AP Databases: AP databases enable availability and partition tolerance, but not consistency. In the event of a partition, all nodes are available, \\nbut they’re not all updated. For example, if a user tries to access data from a bad node, they won’t receive the most up-to-date version of the \\ndata. When the partition is eventually resolved, most AP databases will sync the nodes to ensure consistency across them. Apache Cassandra is \\nan example of an AP database. It’s a NoSQL database with no primary node, meaning that all of the nodes remain available. Cassandra allows \\nfor eventual consistency because users can re-sync their data right after a partition is resolved. For apps like Facebook, we value availability \\nmore than consistency, we’d opt for AP Databases like Cassandra or Amazon DynamoDB. \\nCodeHelp\\nO ·\\n-\\n-\\n---\\n-\\n0- -\\nd~\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n~ -\\n↑ &\\nas~\\n↓ oe\\nShee'),\n",

Not only it helps in writing a complex \\npiece of code easily, but it also allows users to handle and maintain them easily as well. The main pillar of OOPs - Data \\nAbstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism, makes it easy for programmers to solve complex scenarios.\\nWhat is a class?8. \\nA class is a template or a blueprint, which contains some values, known as member data or member, and some set of \\nrules, known as behaviours or functions. So when an object is created, it automatically takes the data and functions \\nthat are deﬁned in the class.\\nWhat is an object?9. \\nAn object refers to the instance of the class, which contains the instance of the members and behaviours deﬁned in the \\nclass template. In the real world, an object is an actual entity to which a user interacts, whereas class is just the \\nblueprint for that object. So the objects consume space and have some characteristic behaviour.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'OOPS_Interview_Cheatsheet.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content=\"What is encapsulation?10. \\nEncapsulation is putting everything that is required to do the job, inside a capsule and presenting that capsule to the \\nuser. What it means is that by Encapsulation, all the necessary data and methods are bind together and all the \\nunnecessary details are hidden to the normal user. So Encapsulation is the process of binding data members and \\nmethods of a program together to do a speciﬁc job, without revealing unnecessary details. \\nEncapsulation can also be deﬁned in two diﬀerent ways: \\n1) Data hiding: Encapsulation is the process of hiding unwanted information, such as restricting access to any member \\nof an object. \\n2) Data binding: Encapsulation is the process of binding the data members and the methods together as a whole, as a \\nclass.\\nWhat is Polymorphism?\\xa0[Microsoft]\\xa0[Intuit]\\xa011. \\nPolymorphism is composed of two words - “poly” which means “many”, and “morph” which means “shapes”. Therefore \\nPolymorphism refers to something that has many shapes. In OOPs, Polymorphism refers to the process by which some \\ncode, data, method, or object behaves diﬀerently under diﬀerent circumstances or contexts.\\nWhat are the two types of Polymorphism?\\xa0[American Express]12. \\nCompile Time Polymorphism: Compile time polymorphism, also known as Static Polymorphism, refers to the type of \\nPolymorphism that happens at compile time. What it means is that the compiler decides what shape or value has to be \\ntaken by the entity in the picture.\\nRuntime Polymorphism:\\xa0Runtime polymorphism, also known as Dynamic Polymorphism, refers to the type of \\nPolymorphism that happens at the run time. What it means is it can't be decided by the compiler. Therefore what \\nshape or value has to be taken depends upon the execution. Hence the name Runtime Polymorphism.\\nHow does C++ support Polymorphism?13. \\nC++ is an Object-oriented programming language and it supports Polymorphism as well:\\nCompile Time Polymorphism: C++ supports compile-time polymorphism with the help of features like templates, \\nfunction overloading, and default arguments.\\nRuntime Polymorphism: C++ supports Runtime polymorphism with the help of features like virtual functions. \\nVirtual functions take the shape of the functions based on the type of object in reference and are resolved at \\nruntime.\\n● \\n● \\nWhat is meant by Inheritance?\\xa0[Goldman Sachs]14. \\nThe term “inheritance” means “receiving some quality or behavior from a parent to an oﬀspring.” In object-oriented \\nprogramming, inheritance is the mechanism by which an object or class (referred to as a child) is created using the \\ndeﬁnition of another object or class (referred to as a parent). Inheritance not only helps to keep the implementation \\nsimpler but also helps to facilitate code reuse.\\nWhat is Abstraction?\\xa015. \\nAbstraction is the method of hiding unnecessary details from the necessary ones. It is one of the main features of \\nOOPs.  \\nFor example, consider a car. You only need to know how to run a car, and not how the wires are connected inside it. \\nThis is obtained using Abstraction.\"),\n",

They are just a blueprint based on which objects are created. Now when objects \\nare created, they actually initialise the class members and methods and therefore consume memory.\\nIs it always necessary to create objects from class?18. \\nNo. An object is necessary to be created if the base class has non-static methods. But if the class has static methods, \\nthen objects don’t need to be created. You can call the class method directly in this case, using the class name.\\nWhat is a constructor?\\xa0[Adobe]19. \\nConstructors are special methods whose name is the same as the class name. The constructors serve the special \\npurpose of initialising the objects. \\nFor example, suppose there is a class with the name “MyClass”, then when you instantiate this class, you pass the \\nsyntax:\\nMyClass myClassObject = new MyClass();\\nWhat are the various types of constructors in C++?20. \\nThe most common classiﬁcation of constructors includes:\\nDefault constructor: The default constructor is the constructor which doesn’t take any argument.

What it means is that a copy \\nconstructor will clone an object and its values, into another object, is provided that both the objects are of the same \\nclass.\\nWhat is a destructor?\\xa0[Oracle]22. \\nContrary to constructors, which initialise objects and specify space for them, Destructors are also special methods. But \\ndestructors free up the resources and memory occupied by an object. Destructors are automatically called when an \\nobject is being destroyed.\\nAre class and structure the same? If not, what's the diﬀerence between a class and a structure?23. \\nNo, class and structure are not the same. Though they appear to be similar, they have diﬀerences that make them \\napart. For example, the structure is saved in the stack memory, whereas the class is saved in the heap memory. Also, \\nData Abstraction cannot be achieved with the help of structure, but with class, Abstraction is majorly used.\\nExplain Inheritance.\\xa0[American Express] [ServiceNow]24. \\nInheritance is one of the major features of object-oriented programming, by which an entity inherits some \\ncharacteristics and behaviours of some other entity and makes them their own. Inheritance helps to improve and \\nfacilitate code reuse.\\nLet me explain to you with a common example. Let's take three diﬀerent vehicles - a car, truck, or bus. These three are \\nentirely diﬀerent from one another with their own speciﬁc characteristics and behavior. But, in all three, you will ﬁnd \\nsome common elements, like steering wheel, accelerator, clutch, brakes, etc. Though these elements are used in \\ndiﬀerent vehicles, still they have their own features which are common among all vehicles. This is achieved with \\ninheritance. The car, the truck, and the bus have all inherited the features like steering wheel, accelerator, clutch, \\nbrakes, etc, and used them as their own. Due to this, they did not have to create these components from scratch, \\nthereby facilitating code reuse.\\nAre there any limitations of Inheritance?25. \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'OOPS_Interview_Cheatsheet.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Yes, Inheritance is a very powerful feature in OOPs, but it has some limitations too. Inheritance needs more time to \\nprocess, as it needs to navigate through multiple classes for its implementation. Also, the classes involved in \\nInheritance - the base class and the child class, are very tightly coupled together. So if one needs to make some \\nchanges, they might need to do nested changes in both classes. Inheritance might be complex for implementation, as \\nwell. So if not correctly implemented, this might lead to unexpected errors or incorrect outputs.\\nWhat are the various types of inheritance?\\xa0[American Express]\\xa0[Microsoft]\\xa026. \\nThe various types of inheritance include:\\nSingle inheritance\\nMultiple inheritances\\nMulti-level inheritance\\nHierarchical inheritance\\nHybrid inheritance\\n● \\n● \\n● \\n● \\n● \\nWhat is an Interface?\\xa0[Goldman Sachs]27. \\nAn interface refers to a special type of class, which contains methods, but not their deﬁnition. Only the declaration of \\nmethods is allowed inside an interface. To use an interface, you cannot create objects. Instead, you need to implement \\nthat interface and deﬁne the methods for their implementation.\\xa0\\nWhat is meant by static polymorphism?28. \\nStatic Polymorphism is commonly known as the Compile time polymorphism. Static polymorphism is the feature by \\nwhich an object is linked with the respective function or operator based on the values during the compile time. Static \\nor Compile time Polymorphism can be achieved through Method overloading or operator overloading.\\nWhat is meant by dynamic polymorphism?29. \\nDynamic Polymorphism or Runtime polymorphism refers to the type of Polymorphism in OOPs, by which the actual \\nimplementation of the function is decided during the runtime or execution. The dynamic or runtime polymorphism \\ncan be achieved with the help of method overriding.\\nWhat is function overloading? Explain with an example.\\xa0[American Express]30. \\nFunction overloading is a feature of object oriented programming where two or more functions can have the same \\nname but diﬀerent parameters.\\n#include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; \\xa0 void print(int i) { \\xa0\\xa0cout << \" Here is int \" << i << endl; }  void print(double \\xa0f) { \\xa0\\xa0cout << \" Here is float \" << f << endl; }  void print(string\\xa0s) { \\xa0\\xa0cout << \" Here is string \" <<\\xa0s\\xa0<< endl; } \\xa0 int main() { '),\n",

For example, method overloading and operator overloading.\\nWhereas Overriding is a runtime polymorphism feature in which an entity has the same name, but its implementation \\nchanges during execution. For example, method overriding.\\nWhat is an abstract class?32. \\nAn abstract class is a special class containing abstract methods. The signiﬁcance of abstract class is that the abstract \\nmethods inside it are not implemented and only declared. So as a result, when a subclass inherits the abstract class \\nand needs to use its abstract methods, they need to deﬁne and implement them.\\nHow is an abstract class diﬀerent from an interface?33. \\nInterface and abstract class both are special types of classes that contain only the methods declaration and not their \\nimplementation. But the interface is entirely diﬀerent from an abstract class. The main diﬀerence between the two is \\nthat, when an interface is implemented, the subclass must deﬁne all its methods and provide its implementation. \\nWhereas when an abstract class is inherited, the subclass does not need to provide the deﬁnition of its abstract \\nmethod, until and unless the subclass is using it.\\nWhat is a friend function?\\xa0[Adobe]\\xa034. \\nA friend function of a class is deﬁned outside that class\\' scope but it has the right to access all private and protected \\nmembers of the class. Even though the prototypes for friend functions appear in the class deﬁnition, friends are not \\nmember functions.\\nA friend can be a function, function template, or member function, or a class or class template, in which case the entire\\nclass and all of its members are friends.\\nclass Box { \\xa0\\xa0 double width; \\xa0\\xa0  \\xa0\\xa0 public: \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0friend void printWidth( Box box ); \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0void setWidth( double wid ); };  // Member function definition void Box::setWidth( double wid ) { \\xa0\\xa0 width = wid; }   void printWidth( Box box ) { \\xa0\\xa0 /* Because printWidth() is a friend of Box, it can \\xa0\\xa0 directly access any member of this class */ \\xa0\\xa0 cout << \"Width of box : \" << box.width <<endl; } '),\n",

The reason for the exception is mainly due to a position in the program, where the user \\nwants to do something for which the program is not speciﬁed, like undesirable input.\\nWhat is meant by exception handling?37. \\nExceptions are the major reason for software failure. The exceptions can be handled in the program beforehand and \\nprevent the execution from stopping. This is known as exception handling. \\nSo exception handling is the mechanism for identifying the undesirable states that the program can reach and \\nspecifying the desirable outcomes of such states. Try-catch is the most common method used for handling exceptions \\nin the program.\\nWhat is meant by Garbage Collection in OOPs world?38. \\nObject-oriented programming revolves around entities like objects. Each object consumes memory and there can be \\nmultiple objects of a class. So if these objects and their memories are not handled properly, then it might lead to \\ncertain memory-related errors and the system might fail.\\nGarbage collection refers to this mechanism of handling the memory in the program. Through garbage collection, the \\nunwanted memory is freed up by removing the objects that are no longer needed.\\nCan we run a Java application without implementing the OOPs concept?39. \\nNo, Java applications are based on object-oriented programming models, and hence they cannot be implemented \\nwithout it.\\nCan we run a C++ application without implementing the OOPs concept?40. \\nYes, C++ can be implemented without OOPs, as it supports the C-like structural programming model.\\nWhat is a virtual function?\\xa0[American Express]\\xa0[Goldman Sachs] [Adobe] [Microsoft]\\xa041. \\nA virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-deﬁned(overriden) by a derived \\nclass.

In other words, it is a way to destroy the unused objects.\\xa0To do so, we use free() function in C language, \\ndelete() in C++, but in Java, it is performed automatically.\\xa0\\nWhat is composition?45. \\nComposition is a way to design or implement the \"has-a\" relationship.\\xa0The composition relationship of two objects is \\npossible when one object contains another object, and that object is fully dependent on it. The contained object \\nshould not exist without the existence of its parent object.\\xa0\\nIn a simple way, we can say it is a technique through which we can describe the reference between two or more \\nclasses. And for that, we use the instance variable, which should be created before it is used.\\nWhat is copy assignment operator?46. \\nThe copy assignment operator lets you create a new object from an existing one by initialisation. A copy assignment \\noperator of a class A is a non-static non-template member function that has one of the following forms:\\nA::operator=(A)\\nA::operator=(A&)\\nA::operator=(const A&)\\nA::operator=(volatile A&)\\nA::operator=(const volatile A&)\\n● \\n● \\n● \\n● \\n● \\nName the operators that cannot be overloaded.47. \\nIn C++, following operators can not be overloaded:\\n. (Member Access or Dot operator)\\n?: (Ternary or Conditional Operator )\\n:: (Scope Resolution Operator)\\n.* (Pointer-to-member Operator )\\nsizeof (Object size Operator)\\ntypeid (Object type Operator)\\n1. \\n2. \\n3. \\n4. \\n5. \\n6. \\nWhat are Manipulators?48. \\nManipulators are helping functions that can modify the input/output stream. It does not mean that we change the \\nvalue of a variable, it only modiﬁes the I/O stream using insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators. For example, if \\nwe want to print the hexadecimal value of 100 then we can print it as:\\xa0\\ncout<<setbase(16)<<100;'),\n",

We can make the constructor explicit with \\nthe help of explicit keyword.\\nWhy is static keyword used?52. \\nStatic is a non-access modiﬁer. It means that something (a ﬁeld, method, block or nested class) is related to the type \\nrather than any particular instance of the type. \\nThe Static keyword can be applied to: \\nStatic Method \\nStatic Variable \\nInitialisation Block \\nNested class\\nWhy is super keyword used?53. \\nThe super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.\\nWhenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly which is referred by super\\nreference variable.\\nWhy is this keyword used?54. \\nthis is a reference variable that refers to the current object.\\nWhy is new keyword used?55. \\nnew keyword is used to create an instance of the class.

It is the ability to selectively concentrate on relevant information while filtering out irrelevant information.\\n\\n2. Components of attention: Attention can be divided into different components such as selective attention (the ability to focus on one stimulus while ignoring others), sustained attention (the ability to maintain focus over an extended period of time), divided attention (the ability to focus on multiple tasks simultaneously), and executive attention (the ability to control and regulate attention).\\n\\n3. Importance of attention: Attention is crucial for various cognitive processes such as learning, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making. It allows individuals to effectively process and respond to information in their environment.\\n\\n4. Factors influencing attention: Attention can be influenced by various factors such as arousal levels, motivation, individual differences, and external distractions. For example, high levels of arousal can enhance attention, while distractions can hinder attention.\\n\\n5. Disorders related to attention: Attention deficits can manifest in various disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which is characterized by difficulties in sustaining attention, controlling impulses, and hyperactivity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, attention is a complex cognitive process that involves focusing on relevant information while filtering out distractions. It plays a crucial role in various cognitive processes and can be influenced by factors such as arousal levels, motivation, and distractions. Understanding attention is essential for improving cognitive functioning and addressing attention-related disorders.'"
